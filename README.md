# Project 1: Memory

## Technologies Used:
JavaScript, HTML, CSS...

## Getting Started:
Link: https://tavy87.github.io/memorycard/

Game starts as soon as link is open

## Next Steps:
endGame: I would have like the end to blink game over or winner if all cards were matched before the timer

timer: I think a sound for the last 10 seconds would be a good warning and a buzzer for the end of the game

cards: Some type of animation to bring the card to life a would be fun
